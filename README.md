# Quantum-data-analytics-python-project
data analytics and visualization of unicorn companies using python and microsoft powerpoint
In My analysis, I imported the needed dictionaries, cleaned the data set, converted the data set into needed datatype.
I plotted the needed charts with adequate labels 
I made commentary at the bottom of each analysis. 
One of the challenges faced is having clustered data labels due to large number of data. i resolved it by limiting my charts to top 10 or 20 as the case may be.
